    <!-- About Me -->
    <p id="brand">
        Junior Software Engineer with a lifelong love for programming. I started with my first if/then logic statements in elementary school and continued to expand that knowledge through high school when I learned Java and OOP on my own. The structure of traditional college was not a match and I decided to pursue real world job experience while determining the best alternatives to pursue my goal of becoming a software engineer. With the knowledge I’ve gained in General Assembly’s program, I am looking forward to joining a tight knit and high performing team in a technical field where I can utilize my skills, contribute to the team and continue to grow personally and professionally.
